# V0.2 Compact Z belt
 Direct drive nema17 belt mod

This MOD was originally created for the Voron Sub 0 but has been adapted for use on the V0.

As space was at a premium (on the Sub 0) it had to be designed to be as compact as possible on the drive side while still using a NEMA 17 motor.

Using a 16 tooth pully and idler to increase tourque to move the bed it also alows the use of a smaller (Pancake) NEMA 17 motor.

 > [!NOTE]
>The belted Nut Block can be used for both the V0 Standard Bed or the Fysect CNC bed and has a built in support for printing!

As it uses a 16 tooth pully it will need a slightly different config for the Z motor section in you PRINTER.CFG file

```rotation_distance: 32```
